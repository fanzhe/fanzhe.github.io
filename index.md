### **Short Bio**:

I obtained my Ph.D degree in Computer Science Department, from the Hong Kong Baptist University (HKBU) in 2015, 
supervised by [Dr. Byron Choi](http://www.comp.hkbu.edu.hk/~bchoi/) and [Prof. Jianliang Xu](http://www.comp.hkbu.edu.hk/~xujl/). 
I received my Bachelor of Engineering degree in School of Computer Science and Engineering, from the South China University of Technology (SCUT) in 2011. 
I was a research visitor at the University of Edinburgh from 2014.10 to 2015.3, supervised by [Prof. Wenfei Fan](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wenfei/), 
and a summer intern at Tencent Inc., ShenZhen, in 2010. 
I was a member of [Database Group](http://www.comp.hkbu.edu.hk/~db/) at HKBU.
